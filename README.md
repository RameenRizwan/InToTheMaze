This is a Top-down view Unity platformer game Completely built on my own!! Using C# for scripting
So I haven't uploaded all the files or the scenes of this game, but there are things I have uploaded to showcase my concepts in Unity and how I have used them in Scripting. 

Here is a little clip of the GamePlay : https://www.loom.com/share/232886e54e054a73abcf84cfbb857992?sid=006d7c33-5b32-4f59-b4e0-b8742dd867da
